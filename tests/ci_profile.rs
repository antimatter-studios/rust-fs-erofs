//! The debug run that lets the PR gate see an overflow guards itself.
//!
//! `overflow-checks` is on in debug and off in release, so a defect
//! whose only symptom is an arithmetic overflow panic cannot be
//! observed by a release-only test run. This repository already runs a
//! debug suite -- `release.yml:71`, `cargo test --locked --all-targets`
//! -- and that is NOT the same fact as the pull-request gate being able
//! to see the defect: `release.yml` triggers on a version tag, after
//! the change has already merged. A wrapping bug merges green here and
//! surfaces only when someone else cuts the next release, detached from
//! the change and from the person who could have caught it.
//!
//! So `ci.yml` -- the workflow that actually gates a merge -- needs its
//! own debug run, and this file is what keeps it there.
//!
//! # Two halves, neither redundant
//!
//! | half | asks | cannot answer |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | the scans here | is the step still in `ci.yml`, asked to check, and not disabled from the manifest | whether the build it produces actually traps |
//! | `overflow_checks` in `src/lib.rs` | does this build trap a real `u64::MAX + 1` | whether it was supposed to; it cannot notice its own absence |
//!
//! Delete the step and the runtime probe never runs at all. Keep the
//! step but drop the variable and the probe runs, finds nothing to
//! check, and passes doing nothing. Keep both and put
//! `overflow-checks = false` under `[profile.test]` and the step is
//! present, running, green and blind. Each needs its own guard.
//!
//! # Why this is an integration test and not a module under `src/`
//!
//! Cargo discovers `tests/*.rs` on its own, so there is no declaration
//! anywhere that can be deleted to switch this off, and `Cargo.toml`
//! sets no `autotests = false`. A guard living as a file under `src/`
//! behind a `#[cfg(test)] mod` line has no such protection: lose the
//! one line and the file stays, compiles into nothing, and asserts
//! nothing, with no lint to say so. That happened once already on a
//! sibling repository's version of this fix -- a `git reset --hard`
//! took the `mod` line, the suite went green, and seven assertions
//! silently ceased to exist.
//!
//! The runtime probe in `src/lib.rs` is the deliberate exception, and
//! is inline in `lib.rs` for the same reason: it must be part of the
//! library target the debug step builds, and inline there is no
//! declaration to lose.
