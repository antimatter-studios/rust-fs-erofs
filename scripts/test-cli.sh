#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-cli.sh — THE `cli` TIER: the command-line tools as installed, found
# on PATH, not a cargo target.
#
# The same suite checks a checkout's build (`chore cli:install` stages it and
# prints the PATH line) and a Homebrew install (`brew install
# antimatter-studios/tap/rust-fs-erofs`): it tests whatever PATH resolves,
# because that is what a user runs.
#
# STEP 1, BEFORE ANY TOOL IS TESTED: the tools are present and are ours.
#   - jq and rust-fs-erofs must resolve, and rust-fs-erofs must answer
#     --version as this crate;
#   - `rust-fs-erofs doctor` must pass: every dotted name on PATH is our
#     program at our version. If one is shadowed -- a distribution's
#     mkfs.erofs, another formula's, an older install of ours --
#     the tier fails with doctor's report: what wins, and the fix.
# NOTHING SKIPS. A missing tool fails the tier naming what provides it; a
# tier that tested someone else's mkfs.erofs and reported green would be
# worse than no tier.
#
# STEP 2: every tests/cli/test-*.sh, by glob, so a new one needs no edit
# here. Each prints its failures, a `test result: ok. N passed; ...` line
# (the count ../rust-fs-core/scripts/test-floor.sh reads, as it does cargo's), and LAST
# `<name>: all checks passed`. A file that exits 0 without that last line
# stopped early and is a failure: `exit 0` part-way through is not evidence
# a file finished.
#
# Quiet: the tier runs under ../rust-fs-core/scripts/tier.sh, which keeps the whole run in
# tmp/logs/cli.log.
#
# CLI_TESTS names another directory of test-*.sh files, for
# tests/scripts/test-cli-tier.sh, which proves every refusal above refuses.
